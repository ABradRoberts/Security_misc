# Security_misc
Misc scripts I make when doing CTFs or security helpers.
None of these scripts are big enough that I want a dedicated project for any of them, but scripts that are big enough that I don't necessarily want them memorized...


Everything I make and put on this repo is for educational purposes only... I in no way condone the use of any of these for malicious intent. Learn from them legally and ethically.
